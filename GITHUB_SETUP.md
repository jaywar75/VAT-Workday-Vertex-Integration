# GitHub Setup Commands

## After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VAT-Workday-Vertex-Integration.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative with SSH (if you have SSH keys set up):
```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/VAT-Workday-Vertex-Integration.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## After pushing, your enhanced diagram will be visible on GitHub!

The Mermaid diagram in your README.md will automatically render on GitHub, showing your multi-audience process flow with interactive elements.

## Future Git Workflow:

```bash
# Make changes to your files
# Add changes to staging
git add .

# Commit changes with descriptive message
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

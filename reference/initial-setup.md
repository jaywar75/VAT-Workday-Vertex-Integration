### 4. Testing and Validation

#### Unit Testing
```
Test Cases:
1. Connection test
2. Authentication test
3. Simple calculation test
4. Error handling test
```

#### Integration Testing
```
Test Scenarios:
1. End-to-end transaction flow
2. Error recovery testing
3. Performance testing
4. Security testing
```

## Configuration Examples

   - Verify firewall rules
   - Confirm service URLs
   - Review authentication credentials

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify username/password
   - Check account permissions
   - Confirm service access
   - Review authentication logs

3. **Calculation Errors**
   - Check data mapping
   - Verify tax rules
   - Confirm product codes
   - Review transaction types

### Error Handling

#### Connection Errors
```
Error: Unable to connect to Vertex service
Solution:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify service URL
3. Confirm firewall rules
4. Contact network administrator
```

#### Authentication Errors
```
Error: Authentication failed
Solution:
1. Verify credentials
2. Check account status
3. Confirm service access
4. Contact Vertex support
```

#### Calculation Errors
```
Error: Tax calculation failed
Solution:
1. Check transaction data
2. Verify tax rules
3. Confirm product mapping
4. Review error logs
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
- Encrypt data in transit
- Secure credential storage
- Regular security reviews
- Access control management

### Compliance Security
- Audit trail maintenance
- Data retention policies
- Access logging
- Change management

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently used tax rules
- Cache customer data
- Cache product classifications
- Monitor cache performance

### Load Management
- Configure connection pooling
- Set up load balancing
- Monitor service performance
- Implement throttling

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
```
Monitor:
- Service availability
- Response times
- Error rates
- Transaction volumes
```

### Regular Maintenance
```
Schedule:
- Weekly: Monitor logs
- Monthly: Review performance
- Quarterly: Update configurations
- Annually: Full system review
```
